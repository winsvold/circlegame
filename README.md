My first javascript/jquery project.
 
Created as I learned to write my first lines of js back in 2013 while I worked at Cern. 
I guess I wanted to make a game inspired by the accelerators at Cern, have protons flying 
around at the speed of light, and then make them crash spectacularly. 

I'm not sure what it actually turned out as, but Im pretty sure it's some kind of game. 

And the code is a mess. Don't judge me, I was young and stupid.

Anyways, enjoy.
